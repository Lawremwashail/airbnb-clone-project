# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application that replicates the core functionality of Airbnb. It is designed to help learners and developers gain hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and user-friendly booking platforms. This project emphasizes backend systems, database design, API development, authentication, and integration with a modern frontend.  

Through this project, contributors can understand real-world software architecture, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while working on a production-style application.

## Project Goals
- Build a robust booking platform with user authentication, property listings, and reservation management.
- Gain practical experience in full-stack development (frontend + backend + database).
- Understand database modeling and relationships between users, listings, and bookings.
- Implement RESTful APIs for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
- Ensure application security with authentication, authorization, and data validation.
- Deploy and scale the application in a production-like environment.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js, CSS/SCSS, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Django
- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL.
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) / OAuth.
- API: RESTful API design for frontend-backend communication.
- Version Control: Git & GitHub for collaboration.
- Deployment: Docker, Vercel, or Heroku.

The project is still under development, and contributions are welcome!

## Team Roles

The development of the Airbnb Clone Project involves different roles, each contributing to the success of the application. Below is an overview of the key roles, their responsibilities, and current assignments:

- Project Manager (Lawrence)  
Oversees the project timeline, milestones, and deliverables. Manages communication, planning, and coordination of different development tasks.

- Frontend Developer (Lawrence)  
Builds the user interface using React.js, CSS/SCSS, and TailwindCSS. Implements responsive design, integrates APIs, and ensures a seamless user experience.

- Backend Developer (Lawrence)  
Develops and maintains the server-side logic using Django. Implements RESTful APIs, authentication, and handles business logic for bookings, users, and property listings.

- Database Administrator (Lawrence)  
Designs and manages the PostgreSQL/MySQL database. Ensures data integrity, optimizes queries, and maintains security and backups.

- DevOps Engineer (Open for Contribution)  
Manages deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization (Docker, Vercel, or Heroku). Ensures the system is scalable and reliable.

- UI/UX Designer (Open for Contribution)  
Creates wireframes, prototypes, and user flows. Focuses on user-friendly design, accessibility, and overall platform aesthetics.

- Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer (Open for Contribution)  
Tests the application for bugs, vulnerabilities, and performance issues. Writes and executes manual/automated test cases to ensure reliability.

- Security Specialist (Open for Contribution)  
Ensures the application follows best practices in authentication, authorization, and data protection. Reviews security measures to prevent vulnerabilities.

Currently, I am handling most of the roles. However, the project is open for collaboration, and contributors are welcome to take on specific roles to strengthen the project.

## Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project uses a modern full-stack technology stack to deliver a scalable and reliable booking platform. Each technology plays a specific role in the development process:

- React.js  
A frontend JavaScript library used for building interactive user interfaces. It allows the creation of reusable components and provides a seamless user experience.

- CSS/SCSS and TailwindCSS  
Styling technologies used to design responsive and visually appealing layouts. TailwindCSS accelerates development with utility-first classes, while SCSS enables modular and maintainable styles.

- Django  
A Python-based web framework that powers the backend of the project. It is responsible for handling business logic, building RESTful APIs, managing authentication, and integrating with the database.

- PostgreSQL / MySQL  
Relational database systems used to store and manage structured data. They maintain relationships between users, listings, and reservations while ensuring data integrity and reliability.

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) / OAuth  
Authentication methods that secure the application. JWT is used to manage user sessions, while OAuth provides an option for third-party logins (such as Google or Facebook).

- RESTful API  
Defines how the frontend and backend communicate. It ensures a standardized way of sending and receiving data between client and server.

- Git and GitHub  
Version control and collaboration tools. Git tracks changes to the codebase, and GitHub provides a platform for hosting, reviewing, and collaborating on the project.

- Docker  
Used for containerization and deployment. It ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments by packaging dependencies and configurations.

- Vercel / Heroku  
Deployment platforms that host the application in production. They provide scalability, automatic builds, and easy integration with GitHub for continuous deployment.


## Database Design

The Airbnb Clone Project uses a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) to store and manage data. The main entities and their relationships are as follows:

Users  
Fields: id, name, email, password, role (guest/host)  
Description: Represents the people using the platform. A user can act as a guest (making bookings) or as a host (listing properties).  

Properties  
Fields: id, user_id (host), title, description, location, price_per_night  
Description: Represents the listings on the platform. Each property belongs to a host (user) and can have multiple bookings.  

Bookings  
Fields: id, user_id (guest), property_id, check_in_date, check_out_date, total_price  
Description: Represents reservations made by guests. A booking belongs to one user (guest) and one property.  

Reviews  
Fields: id, user_id (guest), property_id, rating, comment  
Description: Represents feedback from guests about properties. A review belongs to one user (guest) and one property.  

Payments  
Fields: id, booking_id, amount, payment_method, status  
Description: Represents payments made for bookings. Each payment is linked to one booking.  

Relationships  
- A user (host) can list multiple properties.  
- A property can have many bookings.  
- A booking is made by one user (guest) for one property.  
- A property can have many reviews, each written by a different guest.  
- A booking can have one payment associated with it.  
 

## Feature Breakdown

User Management  
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. Authentication and authorization ensure that users can only access features appropriate to their role (guest or host).  

Property Management  
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details such as title, description, location, price per night, and availability.  

Booking System  
Guests can browse available properties and make reservations. The system manages check-in and check-out dates, calculates total prices, and prevents double bookings.  

Review System  
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature helps maintain trust and transparency within the platform by providing feedback for future guests.  

Payment Processing  
Enables guests to make secure payments for their bookings. Supports different payment methods and ensures transactions are properly recorded and linked to reservations.  

Search and Filtering  
Allows users to search for properties based on location, price, and availability. Filtering options help guests find the most suitable listings quickly.  

Responsive Frontend  
The frontend is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that users can access the platform seamlessly across devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.  

Security Features  
Implements authentication, authorization, and data validation to protect user information and ensure safe transactions. Security is a core part of the system design.
