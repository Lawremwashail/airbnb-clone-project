# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application that replicates the core functionality of Airbnb. It is designed to help learners and developers gain hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and user-friendly booking platforms. This project emphasizes backend systems, database design, API development, authentication, and integration with a modern frontend.  

Through this project, contributors can understand real-world software architecture, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while working on a production-style application.

## Project Goals
- Build a robust booking platform with user authentication, property listings, and reservation management.
- Gain practical experience in full-stack development (frontend + backend + database).
- Understand database modeling and relationships between users, listings, and bookings.
- Implement RESTful APIs for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
- Ensure application security with authentication, authorization, and data validation.
- Deploy and scale the application in a production-like environment.

## Tech Stack
